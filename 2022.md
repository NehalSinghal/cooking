## Insights

1. Adding Carom seeds to namkeen porridge makes it all the more delicious. 
2. Make pumpkin with little ginger grated. 
3. Gooseberries ginger jam is a big thumbs-up! 
4. Carom seeds' fermented (wheat) dough can be used to make [bread/bun](IMG_20230101_174307.jpg) after 24 hours of kneading (Oct, Dehradun). Heat until it's completely cooked on low flame with it covered with glass/steel lid. No foul odor. 
5. **Tadka for sprouts:** Asafoetida, Carom seeds, Rai seeds, dried curry leaves. **Additional** -> Moringa leaves' powder, garlic cloves, can even add chopped onions/spring onions. Use only black salt in sprouts' recipe. 
6. Make ram/pahadi karelas (bitter gourds) in pressure cooker. 
7. Putting crushed _chhoti harad_ in lemon pickle is better than putting uncrushed ones. 
8. About 18 hours soaked black gram can be cooked with potatoes or any other vegetable in iron pan (_sookhi sabzi_) without pre boiling.
