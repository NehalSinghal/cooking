 4. I also soaked about two spoons of methi seeds in the container having dal. 
 5. Grinded rice separately in the mixture after about five hours of soaking. 
 6. After that I grinded dal and methi seeds separately and mixed these with the rice batter.

MFT

Added a pinch of salt while kneading dough to make process it soft in no time. 

I have seen the results, this is true that adding a pinch of salt makes the kneading process smoother and easier. 

Note - For best results use the  kneaded dough instantly. Do not keep it for later. Incase you keep it for later slightly knead it again with lukewarm water.

MFT

Boil pasta and wash in cold water. They'll be extra soft. 

A topping of pickle oil after pasta is prepared gives it a tangy twist.
